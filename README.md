# ParkSmart for Responsive Parking in San Francisco

This project aims to help the SFMTA predict the demand for parking in specific areas and adjust parking rates accordingly. The goal is to make the pricing of parking more responsive to actual demand, rather than being fixed or based on a predetermined schedule. By raising the hourly rates for parking in areas where demand is high, the SFMTA hopes to discourage cruising behavior and reduce congestion on the roads. This, in turn, can help mitigate the negative externalities of congestion, such as air pollution, increased risk of vehicular accidents, and unnecessary fuel consumption. By adjusting the parking rates in advance, the SFMTA can also help prevent a surplus of parking demand and ease congestion in high demand areas. Overall, this new pricing scheme is intended to help the SFMTA better manage parking demand and improve the flow of traffic in the city.
